*********************Inferences And Conclusions********************

1)We have drawn many inferences from the survey.Here's a summary of a few of them: 1)The dataset is skewed towards India and doen't represent the complete data of restaurants worldwide.

2)As Zomato is startup from India hence it makes sense that it has maximum buisness spread across restaurants in India.After that USA and then United Kingdom.

3)Restaurants rating is categorized in six categories. 
  1.Not Rated 
  2.Poor 
  3.Average 
  4.Good 
  5.Very Good 
  6.Excellent

4)India seems to have maximum unrated restaurants.In India the culture of ordering online food is still gaining momentum hence most of the restaurants are still unrated on Zomato as people might be prefers visiting the restaurants for a meal instead of ordering online food.

5)Online deliveries are available in India and UAE only.

6)Maximum number of records or transactions are happening from New Delhi.

7)Connaught Place has maximum restaurants listed on Zomato but in terms of online delivery acceptance Defence colony and Malviya Nagar seems to be doing better.

8)There is no relationship between rating and cost.Some of the best-rated restaurants are low on cost and vice versa.
